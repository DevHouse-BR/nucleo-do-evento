			<title>Packt Awards 2007 — Vote for Joomla!</title>
			<link>http://www.joomla.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3645&amp;Itemid=74</link>
			<description>
 Packt is pleased to announce the
launch date of the 2007 Open Source Content Management System Award as
Monday July 16. Following on from the success of last year, Packt has
expanded the Award for 2007 with an increase in prize money and the
addition of new categories.


As many of you know, Joomla! won the award last year (content/view/2275/74/)  and there is no doubt that community support through voting was a significant factor in our success.  Fingers crossed, you guys can help us win again! 


The 2006 Open Source CMS Award (http://www.linuxelectrons.com/news/application/2006-open-source-content-management-system-award-winner-announced)
was designed to encourage, support, recognize and reward an open source
Content Management System (CMS) selected by a panel of judges and
visitors to PacktPub.com. Following 72 nominations and 15,000 votes,
Joomla! was eventually declared the winner. The 2007 Award will
continue to support open source Content Management Systems and in order
to reward more than one project, Packt has developed new categories for
a wider variety of CMS&amp;rsquo;s to benefit from. These are broken down into
five different categories including the overall winner and the most
promising Open Source CMS:Award is nominations (http://www.packtpub.com/award), which begin on July 16. This is open for visitors to PacktPub.com (http://www.packtpub.com/)
to submit their choice of Open Source Content Management System that
they would like to go through to the final stage. The CMS&amp;rsquo;s that
receive the most votes in their category will go through to the final
stage, which starts in September.

share your views and ask questions about Joomla!.

What is Joomla! Day South Africa?

gathering of all Joomla! users in South Africa - end users, managers,
administrators, developers and service providers to the Joomla!
community. A day of networking, presentations, discussions and fun -
all around the Joomla! Content Management System. Registration is
essential as seats are limited. 

Registration
Register for Joomla! Day South Africa, Johannesburg here ... (http://www.joomladay.co.za/component/option,com_fabrik/Itemid,22/) 

Cost
We
are only charging a R100 event registration fee, which is partly
required to cover travel costs for presenters from Cape Town, Empangeni
and Durban. 

Sponsors
The event itself is not-for-profit so
if there is anyone who could sponsor a venue and/or the refreshments
that would help to reduce costs.  Sponsors would be allowed to present
a slot on the day, on condition that the topic is related to Joomla!

			<title>New (and Rejuvenated) Core Team Members</title>
			<link>http://www.joomla.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3602&amp;Itemid=74</link>
			<description>Today we&amp;#39;re excited to announce the appointment of a new person to the core team &amp;mdash; and the return of an old friend.

Say hello to new core team member Ole Bang Ottosen (http://forum.joomla.org/index.php?action=profile;u=178) and welcome the return of former member Robin Muilwijk (http://forum.joomla.org/index.php?action=profile;u=191).


Ole Bang Ottosen


Ole, 39, of Denmark, will be the new core team translations coordinator (formerly filled by David Gal).

 


Ole,
who describes himself as an &amp;#39;extension freak&amp;#39; has been a long-serving
member of the content team for the Joomla! Extensions Directory (JED). 
He still enjoys keeping the JED up to speed.   He also administers a
local Danish Joomla! support site and works professionally as a Joomla!
solutions provider.

Ole&amp;#39;s content management history started with a migration from ezpublish to Mambo
and then to Joomla!   When Joomla! arrived it was clear, it was the
future project to support,  Ole said.





Robin Muilwijk
 Robin,
37, of the Netherlands, is returning to undertake his old role as
Quality and Testing Coordinator, to assist with delivery of Joomla!
1.5.  



Robin, who had served as a core team member for about a
year, remained active within the community.  He resigned from the core
when his new baby arrived, but after a spell of  paternity leave 
decided he has more time to devote to the Joomla! project.


 Now that I
am getting some more spare time again, I will be picking up on my old
role as Quality and Testing Coordinator.  Robin&amp;#39;s return to the Q T
role will see Rob Schley moving to development.  Exciting challenges
for all these members.
