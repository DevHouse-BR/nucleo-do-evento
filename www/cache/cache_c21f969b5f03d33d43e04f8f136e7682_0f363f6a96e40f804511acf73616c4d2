			<title>New Killington, Vermont Web Site Launched Using Joomla</title>
			<link>http://www.joomla.org/content/view/3652/69/</link>
			<description>
If you've ever gone skiing in Killington, Vermont, you know how difficult it can be to find a good place to stay that isn't an exclusively-priced Luxury Resort. The Edelweiss Lodge and Motel's web site was created with Joomla, pre-1.5 version, and incorporates a great sampling of extensions appropriate for a small motel site.



Thanks to Joomla, easy collaboration between the designer, and the content writer, and the owner allowed a boatload of SEO content to be created without risking anything. The designer designed, the content creator had limited access, and the owner had complete control. 1 month worth of work, and a complete web site appeared.
